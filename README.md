## What is it and Why I build it

In the endless summer the balcony becomes so hot for me to go checking daily, I always forget to water my plants on schedule and they dies on me.

On the simple idea of keeping records of the last time I watered plants and calculating the next date with normal watering schedule with each plant, I implement this gardening work tracking application to get notified as a todo task when the next event comes without me going out to feel the soil and observe leaves everyday, and also enjoy crossing off all the checkboxes after completing the garden work.


## Features

- Watering tracking:
 It will appear as a todo task when the next watering date is due and auto update the last watered date when the task is checked as completed.  
 All works are presented simple and clear with checkboxes.

- Besides watering, user can choose to add usual gardening activities for todo tasks - fertilizing & repotting.  

- Save/update plant info anytime.

- Manage gardening activities:  
 With considerations for varying growing environments of plants, user can specify and alter their own schedule of gardening activities instead of setting a fixed one. (with the normal activity frequecy suggested)

- When a scientific name for the plant is available or on added, wiki extract will generate for users to learn more about the plants in garden.



## Distinctiveness and Complexity

- Implemented models CRUD functions both via rendering templates with modelForms and api ajax functions

- Similar activities are implemented both as fields of a model (watering activity) and another model of foreign key relationship (fertilizing and repotting activities).

- Implemented the quitting of adding/editing activities for better UX.

- Warning popup implemented before deleting the plant.

- Timedelta utilized to calculate the next comming event.

- Format time functions employed for unification of multiple time formats frontend and backend.

- Utilizes wiki api to generate extract.

- Widgets utilized to implement date picker with the datefields and for customizations of CSS and id.

- Future dates are disabled both frontend in dateinput (js function) and backend (validators).

- Plant Image field implemented with default image and resized output utilizing pillow library.

- Django forms dynamically rendered using Ajax.

- Customized CSS

- For minimalistic UI, details are designed as hover to display.
